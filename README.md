Holographic Memory
------------------
Holographic data storage as a viable alternative to magnetic disk data storage. Currently data access
times are extremely slow for magnetic disks when compared to the speed of execution of CPUs
so that any improvement in data access speeds will greatly increase the capabilities of computers,
especially with large data and multimedia files. Holographic memory is a technology that uses a three
dimensional medium to store data and it can access such data a page at a time instead of sequentially,
which leads to increases in storage density and access speed. Holographic data storage systems are
very close to becoming economically feasible. Obstacles that limit holographic memory are hologram
decay over time and with repeated accesses, slow recording rates, and data transfer rates that need to
be increased.
